Los Angeles (or major cities) Crime Data and Trend Over Time (over decades)

Tracking Crime data is crucial for law enforcement agencies and citizens. There are many victims living with trauma or even citizens who have fear from becoming victims. The ability to avoid hot spots for crime would be great for civilians, also law enforcement would be able to note where to patrol and keep in check.

Different interactive features include:
- An overall view of Los Angeles (depending on data we can expand to state or country).
- Historic and current criminal reports.
- Multiple layers based on the category of the report.
- Chart showing the count of cases by cities
